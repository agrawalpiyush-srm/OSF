This project aims to develop an integrative multi-omics computational framework to identify robust biomarkers and prioritize potential therapeutic targets by jointly modeling heterogeneous biological signals within a unified analytical space. Diverse omics-derived features capturing sequence, molecular, and functional attributes were harmonized into a consistent feature representation to enable cross-dataset applicability and reproducible inference. To systematically identify discriminative biomarkers while minimizing bias, multiple supervised machine-learning models were evaluated using a rigorous nested Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) strategy with internal hyperparameter optimization. Model performance was assessed using AUROC and AUPRC metrics to ensure robustness under class imbalance. Comparative analysis demonstrated that the ExtraTrees classifier most effectively captured non-linear interactions across integrated omics features and exhibited superior stability, leading to its selection as the final deployable model. The optimized model was retrained on the complete dataset using consensus hyperparameters and released alongside feature specifications and inference scripts to support transparent validation, independent testing, and downstream translational applications in biomarker discovery and therapeutic target prioritization.
